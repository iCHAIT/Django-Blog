blog-functionality
==================

This is a very basic blog functionality for people who want to include a simple blog(feature) for their website,provided that they are using the Django framework!!!


==================
Please note:

This blog functionality can only be used if you are using the Django framework.

I have used MySQL however you can use the Databse of your choice,provided it is supported by Django.

Blogs here can only be written by the admin,the user will have only read-only rights.

For setting up the admin configuration read the Django docs for admin settings!!

index.html can be manipulated according to one's requirement,corresponding css and js can be included for making it more lively(responsive)!!
